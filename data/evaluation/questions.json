      "question": "WP3 does use an auto on high rotation points compared time spent not racing through those tracks and playing outside where others perform other slow shifting events in?",
      "answer": "As the \"ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel\" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem (\"I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that public house of my childhood\"), the \"ma\u00eetress d'h\u00f4tel\" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life, while the Waiter engages in \"interjections\" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime.",
